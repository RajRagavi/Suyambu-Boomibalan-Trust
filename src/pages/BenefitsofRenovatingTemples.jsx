          Restoring and rebuilding temples bring immense Punya Karma and divine
          blessings. Even a small offering, like a brick or a flower, holds
          great spiritual significance. Supporting temple rituals and the needy
          ensures lasting rewards in Kailash or Vaikuntha.

                  Once, Mahaperiyava of the Kanchipuram lineage narrated a story
                  that highlights the immense merit one gains by engaging in
                  noble acts. Punya Karma, or meritorious deeds, is earned when
                  we contribute to any sacred cause.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2 ">
                  A Brahmin was searching for something in the street when a
                  passerby inquired about his distress. The Brahmin explained
                  that he had lost a single paisa, which he had set aside to buy
                  bananas for his Shiva Puja. Seeing his devotion and the
                  urgency of the Puja, the kind passerby offered him a paisa,
                  enabling him to complete his offering to the deity.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2 ">
                  Sometime later, Indra visited Yama Dharmaraja, who welcomed
                  him warmly. Inside Yama’s palace, two divine beings arrived in
                  celestial chariots. Yama respectfully invited them in,
                  offering one a golden throne and the other a diamond throne.
                  Curious, Indra asked why these souls had received such honor.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2 ">
                  Yama explained, “The one seated on the golden throne is a
                  devotee who faithfully performed Shiva Puja daily. The one on
                  the diamond throne is the noble soul who once helped him by
                  offering a single paisa for his Puja. Because of this act, he
                  has received a greater reward.” Indra was astonished and
                  acknowledged the profound truth—helping others perform divine
                  acts brings even greater merit than performing them oneself.

                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2 ">
                  This story teaches us an invaluable lesson—when we hear of
                  temple restoration, reconstruction, or Kumbabhishekam, we
                  should seize the opportunity to contribute, no matter how
                  small our offering may be. Even the simplest contribution
                  brings immense blessings and transforms our lives in powerful
                  ways.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2 ">
                  Those who take part in such sacred deeds experience
                  prosperity, honor, and fulfillment in this life and beyond.
                  They regain lost opportunities, live with dignity, and attain
                  divine status in the afterlife. Their families flourish across
                  generations, blessed with health, wealth, and knowledge,
                  earning widespread respect.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2 ">
                  Even beyond this earthly realm, the merit from temple
                  contributions liberates our ancestors from suffering, whether
                  they are restless souls, trapped in the ancestral plane, or
                  enduring hardships in Naraka Lokha. Within one Mandalam (48
                  days) of performing such Punya Karma, their souls receive
                  peace, elevation, or even Moksha (liberation).
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2 ">
                  This eternal truth reminds us that contributing to temple
                  service is not just an act of devotion—it is a path to divine
                  grace, prosperity, and spiritual liberation.

                Spiritual Merits of Restoring Temples in Sacred Scriptures
              </h3>
              <div>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2">
                  The ancient scriptures emphasize the immense spiritual merit
                  of constructing temples for deities. According to the Agni
                  Purana, even the mere thought of building a temple can erase
                  sins accumulated over multiple lifetimes. Completing such a
                  sacred task not only blesses the builder but also liberates a
                  hundred generations, both past and future, from suffering. The
                  act of temple construction grants spiritual benefits
                  equivalent to performing great yajnas (sacrificial rituals)
                  and bathing in all sacred rivers. Even contributing a small
                  amount toward temple renovation or maintenance brings divine
                  blessings and ensures a place in the celestial realms.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-black mt-2">
                  The Vamana Purana further states that building a Vishnu temple
                  safeguards eight generations of ancestors from falling into
                  lower realms. Those who construct temples or contribute to
                  their upkeep are granted access to higher spiritual planes,
                  including Vaikuntha, the eternal abode of Lord Vishnu.
                  Additionally, offering gardens with fruit-bearing trees and
                  flowers for temple worship is considered a noble act that
                  brings heavenly pleasures and divine rewards. Even those who
                  repair existing temples earn spiritual merit, ensuring peace,
                  prosperity, and liberation for themselves and their families.
